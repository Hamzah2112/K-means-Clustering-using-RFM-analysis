**Task:**

Here we would need to create a model which assigns a customer to a certain customer category based on the total value of orders theyâ€™ve placed. This would let us target the most valuable customers with certain offers which promote a higher spend.

**Data Set Information:**
The dataset is a CSV, where each row represents an sku which is a part of an order. The different columns are described below. Every conversation included has at least one request from a consumer and at least one response from a company. Which user IDs are company user IDs can be calculated using the inbound field.

*Attribute Information:*

**InvoiceNo**

A single invoice number represents one order that was placed. There might be multiple rows for the same invoice number, representing the different SKUs that were ordered.

**StockCode**

This represents the sku for the particular item that was ordered.

**Description**

This describes the exact item that was ordered in words.

**Quantity**

The quantity of the specific sku that was ordered.

**InvoiceDate**
